# Password-Generator

This project aims to provide users with randomly generated strings of symbols, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters of a length between 8 and 128 characters. Users can choose which character types to use and determine the length of the string. Once the string is generated users can then copy the it to a clipboard to, ostensibly, use as a unique password.
